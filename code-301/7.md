# Day 7 Notes
## Statement
REST APIs are one of the major ways to get data from other machines. Being able to work with APIs will allow me to use many types of data in my applications.

## A Conversation about REST with my brother
***

> Who is Roy Fielding?

A researcher that helped write the first web servers and worked on the HTTP protocol.

> Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they were designed to be used with a small group of machines.

> What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

A way for the browser to use verbs to tell the server how to manipulate data.

> What does a GET do?

It requests information from the server.

> What does a POST do?

It adds information to the server.

> What does PUT do?

It replaces information on the server.

> What does PATCH do?

It does a partial update to information on the server.

## Things I want to know more about
A Patch is a partial update. But why would you want to "partially" update data? What would that even look like?
