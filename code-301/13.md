# Day 13 Notes
## Statement

CRUD is the foundation for RESTful APIs, so it's important to know how it relates.

***

## CRUD Basics
***
> Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

Either a PUT or a PATCH.

> Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

PUT/PATCH and DELETE.

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API
***

> Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST methods are based off the CRUD operations, meaning that a RESTful API should have CRUD functionality at its base (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

> If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

* Make GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE routes.
* Connect to a database.
* Have callbacks that the routes call that read the request and perform operations on the database.
* Send a response back for the API requests.
* Handle errors.

## Things I want to know more about
Can you have an API that is not RESTful? At least, an API that functions well? Because it seems like REST and CRUD cover the core operations that you'd want for the uses of an API, I'm not sure what case would want a non-RESTful API.
