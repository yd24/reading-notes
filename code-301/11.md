# Day 11 Notes
## Statement

Databases are the backbone of backend services, so learning about the different types of databases there are and which ones are appropriate for which use cases is important to know for properly setting up the backend.

## nosql vs sql
***

> Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
| --- | ----- |
| Relational, table-based database. | Document-based, key-value pair database.|
| Predefined schema.| Dynamic schema.|
| Vertically scalable. | Horizontally scalable. |
| Uses SQL (structured query language). | Unstrucuted query language varies depending on database. |

> What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Complex transactional data that may stretch across many types of data points.

> Give a real world example.

Tracking store orders, where you might want to update information about a data point without affecting or having to 
update many other data points.

> What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Complex data, but that can be stored in fewer sets and mainly be used for reads.

> Give a real world example.

An inventory list of items.

> Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL.

> Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL for scalability in terms of large data sets. SQL for scalability in terms of complex data processes.



## sql vs nosql
***

> What does SQL stand for?

Structured query language.

> What is a relational database?

A relational database is one where the data points can have relations to each other. 

> What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Tables with rows.

> What is a ‘schema’?

A schema is a format for the data that is going to be stored in a table. The required elements that the data must have.

> What is a NoSQL database?

A NoSQL database is a document-based store using key/value pairs.

> How does it work?

It uses collections (similar to tables) and has documents with key/value pairs, but no relational model. So instead of having
data points that can reference other data points, you just have big piles of data.

> What is inside of a MongoDB database?

Collections of documents.

> Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible because you don't have to adhere to a schema and you can put in whatever data you want into datasets.

> What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

If you have complex data models, it can require a lot of duplicate effort having to update data across multiple datasets. In addition, because a NoSQL database has no pre-defined schema, efforts need to be made to validate data or handle malformed data entries.

## Things I want to know more about

While it seems like NoSQL databases generally have better performance than SQL databases, I'm wondering how NoSQL can scale in larger and more complex applications, as it seems like complex data models would be hard to manage in a schemaless database.
