# Prework Notes for Terminal

## Summary
Using a command line terminal is a powerful way to navigate and manage your system. While a GUI is more intuitive and simple to use, the command line allows you to take more specific actions and can also do things such as automating or performing complex actions with just a single line.

## Some common commands to use:
* pwd (lists current working directory)
* ls (lists out files/directories)
* cd (allows you to move through directories)
* mv (allows you to move files/directories)
* rm (allows you to delete files/directories)
* cp (allows you to copy/paste files/directories)

## Some interesting things to note:
* Linux is an extensionless system. Linux can determine a filetype by looking at the actual file, it does not need the extension to match the filetype.
* You can use quotes in Linux to specify literal names (rather than parsing them as commands).
* Adding a . to the beginning of a file will make it hidden
* touch is actually a command for modifying timestamps on a file, but it can also be used to create an empty file.
