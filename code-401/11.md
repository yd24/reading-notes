# Day 11 Reading - Event-Driven Programming

## Event-Driven Programming

> What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

The EventEmitter module, which is basically a module that lets you manage EventListeners and callbacks.

> What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Through Event-Driven programming, we can have the objects themselves process things whenever an event is triggered rather than having external forces act on the object.

> Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

With Node.js, there is a lot of asynchronous code that happens. Using Event Driven programming can be very useful for setting up triggers on events that may not happen sequentially or at pre-determined times.

## Additional Questions

> Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I look forward to building a messaging app through Express.

> What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

I'd like to learn how to properly manage event emitters to handle dynamic code.

## Things I want to know more about

I'd like to learn about Socket.io, which I think is another way clients can communicate with each other via the server.
