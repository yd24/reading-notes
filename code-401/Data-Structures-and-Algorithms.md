# Data Structures and Algorithms

> What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

You should consider how you're going to manipulate this data as some operations such as add/remove are easier on certain data structures over others.

> How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

We have a base case that stops the recursive call.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about graphs as it's a data structure that I didn't have much exposure to. Somewhat related, does GraphQL also make use of graphs?
