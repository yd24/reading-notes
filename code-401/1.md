# Day 1 Reading

## Node Ecosystem
> How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

I would say that Node is kind of like a translator. It takes code that you have written and translates it into something that
the browser can interpret and process an output from. 

> What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node is something that allows us to execute Javascript on our machines. It is basically an enhanced Javascript compiler that translates Javascript to something that our computers can execute.

> What is Node used for?

Node is used for a lot of the packages that Javascript programs work with today. It is also one of the most popular
implementations for having a Javascript server.

> Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I look forward to getting my feet wet with AWS deployments as it's seems to be a very popular environment for web developers. I am also interested in learning the use of Material UI and React Native for mobile apps as I found Bootstrap to be a bit limiting when modern apps seem highly responsive and interactive.

> What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

I want to become comfortable working in a Node environment and the CI/CD workflow.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about the capabilities that Node has, as it seems to be a very powerful tool for web development.
