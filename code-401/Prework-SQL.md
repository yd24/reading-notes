# Prework Notes for SQL

## Summary
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a way to interface with relational databases. Relational databases are based on the relationship between entities. The idea is that by having tables that are connected by relationships, one can manage data without having excess duplicates and can handle complex data updates more cleanly. 

SQL queries can be constructed using a series of keywords:
SELECT - For retrieving data
INSERT - For inserting data
UPDATE - For updating data
DELETE - For deleting data
WHERE - To narrow down data by a constraint
ORDER BY - To order the data
LIMIT - To limit the amount of data returned
OFFSET - To offset the range of data being returned
GROUP BY - To group data that is resulting from aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, etc
etc

You can use these keywords and various operators to manage data in a fine-grained way. Due to the relational aspect of the SQL databases, you can also use keywords such as JOIN to combine tables together.

SQL and the databases that make use of the language are powerful tools for managing real-world data, as oftentimes real-world data involves complex relationships.
