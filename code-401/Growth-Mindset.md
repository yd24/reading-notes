## Emotional Intelligence

Self Awareness: 20
Self Management: 19
Social Awareness: 20
Relationship Management: 18

In general, my emotional intelligence seems to be at appropriate levels. However, parts I noticed that I wasn't as confident in was taking in others' viewpoints and regulating my emotions. I believe that I can do this in normal situations, however I think that if I was frustrated or upset, it is harder for me to maintain empathy and control over my emotions. The main way I've dealt with this is finding ways to avoid becoming frustrated or upset in the first place, but I think I need to also find ways to cope with the emotion more during the moment.

## Biases

Based off my Biases assessment, it seems that I have a good amount of empathy and understanding of my own biases. However, I scored lower in areas where I have to act on changing those biases by making new connections or speaking up in uncomfortable situations. I suppose I don't feel as much of a need to go out of my way to challenge my biases or improve on my understanding of them. But this might be something I should work on, perhaps by encouraging myself to gain exposure to new perspectives.

## Things I want to know more about
