## Discussion Questions
* What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    * Having worked in both retail and logistics-related roles, I've been able to see how technology has been integrated into an increasingly globalized world. I bring the perspective of how front-line workers view and use technology in their day-to-day tasks.
* What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    * Take a break and come back with fresh eyes.
    * Use Google to help me understand the problem or concept better.
    * Try to break down the issue into smaller problems that I can tackle.
